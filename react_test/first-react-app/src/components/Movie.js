            <h1>Beverly Hills Chihuahua</h1>
            <p>Beverly Hills Chihuahua has a deleted scene that is only on the DVD special features where the dogs drink ayahuasca and they travel back in time to ancient mexico and they stop a prince from being eaten by a snake and it alters the course of history. Also the director's commentary is really good, the director is basically just like "I hate that I have to work on this but it was good for my reel so I just tried to make sure it looked good." It's actually a REALLY GOOD movie and it's extremely funny (mostly in that it is NOT funny, it has almost no intentionally comedic moments, just super serious moments with dog actors instead of people actors). It's so fucking good I've watched it with the director's commentary on like three times.</p>

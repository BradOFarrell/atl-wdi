## Hangman Game Project

This is a hangman game made as a project for my General Assembly class. It was an exercise in proper data structure and JQuery manipulation.

### Spec

The javascript consists of two objects:
GameLogic, which controls the Hangman gameplay, and GameUI, which renders the gameplay in the HTML.
The Game Logic should have the following attributes:
* Selects new puzzle
* Tracks mistakes
* Tracks available and used letters
* Allows player to guess a leter
* Checks for a win (guess matches the answer)
* Checks for a lose (5 mistakes are made)
The Game UI object should have the following attributes:
* Render buttons that the player can use as input
* Remove buttons as they are used
* Render the "hangman" drawing
* Fill in the clue as the player makes correct guesses
